# Excursion Project
* In this project, I was tasked with completing a website which advertises a product called "Excursion". Using only HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.
* This website was created using the two mock images provided in the **specs** file. I was also provided all of the resources in the **videos** file and the **images** file. 
* All implementations were done through git, using the command line, and pushed remotely to GitHub.
